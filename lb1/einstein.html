	<h1>Albert Einstein</h1>

	<h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
  <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who is best known for his theory of relativity and his mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc². He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire.</p>
  <p>Einstein attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, Switzerland, where he studied physics and mathematics. After graduation, he worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he began to develop his theories about relativity.</p>
  <p>In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers on his theory of relativity, which challenged the previously accepted Newtonian view of space and time. This theory led to a new understanding of the universe and established Einstein as one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.</p>
  <p>Einstein continued to work on his theories, and in 1915, he published his general theory of relativity, which extended the previous theory and included the effects of gravity. During this time, Einstein also became an outspoken pacifist and civil rights advocate, using his fame to speak out against war and oppression.</p>
  <p>In 1933, Einstein emigrated to the United States to escape Nazi persecution, and he eventually settled in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study until his death in 1955.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photoelectric Effect:</strong> In 1905, Einstein provided a theoretical explanation of the photoelectric effect, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</li>
      <li><strong>Special Theory of Relativity:</strong> Also in 1905, Einstein introduced the theory of special relativity, which transformed the classical mechanics of Galileo and Newton. The theory is based on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames, and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant regardless of the motion of the source or observer.</li>
      <li><strong>Mass-Energy Equivalence:</strong> In 1905, Einstein also introduced the famous equation E=mc^2, which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy. This equation revolutionized the understanding of energy and matter, and was crucial for the development of atomic energy.</li>
      <li><strong>General Theory of Relativity:</strong> In 1915, Einstein introduced the theory of general relativity, which extended the special theory of relativity to include gravity. The theory describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter and energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Cosmological Constant:</strong> In 1917, Einstein introduced the cosmological constant to his theory of general relativity, in order to explain the observed static universe. Later, when the universe was found to be expanding, Einstein called the introduction of the constant his "biggest blunder."</li>
      <li><strong>Bose-Einstein Condensate:</strong> In 1925, Einstein and Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose predicted the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensate, which occurs at extremely low temperatures and involves a macroscopic number of particles occupying the same quantum state. The prediction was later confirmed experimentally.</li>
    </ul>

	<h2 id="emc2">E=mc<sup>2</sup></h2>
	<p>One of the most famous equations in physics is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, often written as E=mc<sup>2</sup>. This equation shows the relationship between mass and energy: energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared.</p>
  <p>The equation was first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 as part of his theory of special relativity, which revolutionized the way physicists think about space and time. According to special relativity, the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant speeds relative to each other, and the speed of light is constant in all reference frames.</p>
  <p>The mass-energy equivalence equation has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and technology. It has been used to explain the behavior of subatomic particles, to study the structure of the universe, and to develop new sources of energy.</p>

  <h2 id="later-life">Personal Life and Later Years</h2>
  <p>After the war, Einstein continued to work on his theories and became more politically active, advocating for disarmament and world peace. In 1919, he divorced Mileva and married his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. They moved to Berlin, where Einstein was appointed to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and began working on his unified field theory, attempting to unify the laws of physics into a single theory.</p>
  <p>In 1933, with the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, Einstein emigrated to the United States and took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. He became an American citizen in 1940 and continued to work on his theories until his death on April 18, 1955. Einstein is remembered as one of the most brilliant and influential scientists of the 20th century, and his theories continue to shape our understanding of the universe.</p>
  <h2 id="legacy">Legacy and Impact</h2>
  <p>Einstein's work revolutionized the field of physics and had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. His theories of relativity challenged and ultimately replaced the classical physics of Isaac Newton, and his work on quantum mechanics helped to lay the foundation for modern particle physics. In addition to his scientific contributions, Einstein was also a committed pacifist and humanitarian, advocating for disarmament and social justice throughout his life.</p>
  <p>Einstein's legacy continues to inspire scientists and thinkers around the world, and his name has become synonymous with genius and innovation. He remains an icon of scientific achievement and a symbol of the power of human curiosity and imagination.</p>
